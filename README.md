# Weather Data Management System ðŸŒ¤

This project is a *Weather Data Management System* implemented in *C++*.  
It efficiently stores, manages, and analyzes temperature records for different cities across multiple years using an *Abstract Data Type (ADT)* and a *2D array*.  
The system supports inserting, deleting, retrieving, and displaying records, while handling sparse data and performing row/column traversals.

## Key Features

- *Weather Record ADT*  
  Attributes: Date, City, Temperature  
  Methods: insert, delete, retrieve records

- *2D Array Storage*  
  Organizes year-wise and city-wise temperature data for structured access

- *Sparse Data Handling*  
  Efficiently manages missing or unavailable data

- *Core Operations*  
  - *Insert:* Add new weather records  
  - *Delete:* Remove records by city/date  
  - *Retrieve:* Search and fetch records quickly  
  - *Display:* View dataset in a readable format  

- *Traversals & Analysis*  
  Supports *row-major* and *column-major* traversal

- *Complexity Analysis*  
  Evaluates *time* and *space complexity* for different operations

## Use Cases

- Tracking city-wise temperature over multiple years  
- Performing statistical analysis on weather trends  
- Learning ADTs, 2D arrays, and complexity evaluation in C++
