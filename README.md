# Weather-Data-Storage-System
This project is a Weather Data Management System built in C++. It stores temperature records for different cities across multiple years using an Abstract Data Type (ADT) and a 2D array structure. The system supports operations like inserting, deleting, and retrieving records, handling sparse data, and performing row/column traversals along with complexity analysis.
